# Scanner_Table
Arduino code to drive a custom photogrammetry scanner table.

The scanner table itself is designed using Onshape and the design files are located here:

Once it is finished, it will also be posted to Thingiverse with proven printable stl files.  The scanner table is almost
entirely 3D printed.  It will use a NEMA 17 stepper motor and will automatically trigger a camera to take shots at a programmable angular interval.  Once the camera type is set in code, the angular interval will be programmable via an IR remote.
